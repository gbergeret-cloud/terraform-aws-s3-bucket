# terraform-aws-s3-bucket

This module creates an S3 bucket with versioning, mfa_delete, encryption and a
default policy.

## Basic
* Prevent bucket from being publicly accessible
* Enable versioning (with MFA Delete protection)
* Enable default bucket encryption using `AES256`
* Prevent unencrypted object push (`DenyPutObjectWithoutEncryption`)

## Usage

**IMPORTANT**: We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest
released versions. We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to
the exact version you are using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and
update versions in a systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

```hcl
module "aws_s3_bucket" {
  source = "git@github.com:gbergeret/terraform-aws-s3-bucket"

  bucket = "assets"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Test"
  }
}
```
